# Introduction

# Data

This script uses the data file `EvoLang_Scores_8_to_12.csv`:

-  conference:  Which conference the paper was submitted to
-  gender: Gender of first author
-  Score.Mean:  Mean raw score given by reviewers (scaled between 0 and 1, higher = better paper)
-  student: The student status of the first author at submission.

All variables with an underscore are measures of readability.  Below we calculate a variable `review`, which represents the type of review (Single / Double blind).

Combined student and gender:

```{r}

ad2 = allData[allData$conference!="E8",]

ggplot(ad2, mapping = aes(y=Score.mean,
           x=stuGen,
           colour=student))+
  geom_boxplot(varwidth = 0.5) 

allData$stuFor = factor(paste(allData$format,
                              allData$student))

ggplot(allData[!is.na(allData$student),],

# Review ranks by gender and student status

Are papers with female first authors ranked higher than those with male first authors under double-blind review?

Using a simple anova, there's a significant interaction between gender and review type:

```{r}
summary(aov(Score.mean ~ FirstAuthorGender*student*review*format,
            data=allData[allData$conference!="E8",]))
```

However, it looks like this is driven just by EvoLang11:

```{r}
t.test.string = function(tx){
  t = signif(tx$statistic,2)
  df = tx$parameter['df']
  p = signif(tx$p.value,3)
  est = signif(diff(tx$estimate),2)
  
  paste("(difference in means = ",est,", t = ",t,", p = ",p,")",sep = "")
}
for(conf in levels(allData$conference)){
  print(conf)
  print(t.test.string(t.test(Score.mean~FirstAuthorGender, data=allData[allData$conference==conf,])))
}
```

There is also a significant main effect of first author gender.


The model above mots EvoLang 8 because it has no data for student status. We get the same results if we omit student status and run the test for all conferences:

```{r}
summary(aov(Score.mean ~ FirstAuthorGender*review*format,
            data=allData))
```


\newpage

## Mixed effects model

Alternatively, we can use a mixed effects model, with random slopes for conference and test whether the interaction between gender and review type is a significant fixed predictor.  A random intercept is not necessary, because the data is scaled to be centered around 0 within each conference.  A random slope for the interaction between gender and review is also not permissable, since review type does not vary by conference.


```{r warning=F}

contrasts(allData$FirstAuthorGender) <- contr.sum(2)/2
contrasts(allData$review) <- contr.sum(2)/2
contrasts(allData$student) <- contr.sum(2)/2
contrasts(allData$format) <- contr.sum(2)/2

m0 <- lmer(
      Score.mean ~ 
        1 + (FirstAuthorGender*review*student*format) +
        (0+FirstAuthorGender+student+format|conference),
      allData[allData$conference!="E8",],
  control=lmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa",optCtrl = list(maxfun=10000000)),
  REML = T
) 

summary(m0)
```

The results above suggest that there's no overall interaction between gender and review type.  The tendency is there, but from the plots it's probably just driven by EvoLang 11.

We can run the same model without student status to include data from EvoLang 8:

```{r}
m0 <- lmer(
      Score.mean ~ 
        1 + (FirstAuthorGender*review*format) +
        (0+FirstAuthorGender+format|conference),
      allData,
  control=lmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa",optCtrl = list(maxfun=10000000)),
  REML = T
) 

summary(m0)
```

Again, there's no interaction between gender and review type.

\newpage

## Permutation test

The distributions of score means are not very normal within conferences.  We run a permutation test to address this.  We calculate the average difference between single blind and double blind scores for males (dM) and for females (dF).  Then we calculate dF - dM. A value > 0 means females scores increase more than male scores under double blind review. This 'true difference' is compared to a 'permuted difference'.  The association between review scores and review type is randomly permuted, and dF - dM is calculated again.  This is done 10,000 times to compare the true difference to a distribution of random differences.

```{r}
meanDifferenceBetweenGenders = function(d){
  # difference in means between review types
  # for males
  # (change from single to double)
  diffMales = diff(rev(tapply(d[d$FirstAuthorGender=="M",]$Score.mean,
              d[d$FirstAuthorGender=="M",]$review,
              mean)))
  # for females
  diffFemales = diff(rev(tapply(d[d$FirstAuthorGender=="F",]$Score.mean,
              d[d$FirstAuthorGender=="F",]$review,
              mean)))
  # difference in differences
  # value > 0 means female scores increase 
  # more under double-blind review than male scores
  return(diffFemales-diffMales)
}

perm = function(d){
  d$review = sample(d$review)
  meanDifferenceBetweenGenders(d)
}

perm.test = function(d,title){
  n = 10000
  trueDiff = meanDifferenceBetweenGenders(d)
  permDiff = replicate(n, perm(d))
  
  p = sum(permDiff>trueDiff) / n
  z = (trueDiff-mean(permDiff)) / sd(permDiff)
  print(paste("p=",p,", z=",z))
  hist(permDiff,xlab="Female advantage in double-blind",main=title)
  abline(v=trueDiff,col=2)
}
```

Permutation test for all data:

```{r}
perm.test(allData,
          "All conferences")
```

Permutation test without E11 data:

```{r}
perm.test(allData[allData$conference!="E11",],
          "Without E11")
```

Permutation test without E12 data:

```{r}
perm.test(allData[allData$conference!="E12",],
          "Without E12")
```

The results are in line with the test above. Across the whole data, females are given higher scores in double-blind, but this is driven by E11 alone.

\newpage

## Decision tree exploration

Construct a decision tree, attempting to predict review socres by format, student status, gender, review model and conference.

```{r}
set.seed(2389)
for(f in c("conference","format",'student','FirstAuthorGender','review')){
  allData[,f] = as.factor(allData[,f])
}
ct = ctree(Score.mean ~ format + student  +  
             FirstAuthorGender + review + conference, data=allData)
plot(ct)
```

Work out differences between leaves of the tree:

```{r}
paperVabstract = tapply(allData$Score.mean,allData$format,mean)
paperVabstract

pStudentVpNonStuent = tapply(allData[
  allData$format=="Paper",]$Score.mean,
  allData[allData$format=="Paper",]$student,mean)
pStudentVpNonStuent
```

The tree suggests that full papers are given lower ratings than abstracts on average (about `r round(abs(diff(paperVabstract))/diff(range(allData$Score.mean))*100,1)`% difference).  
For full papers, students are given higher ratings than non-students
(about `r round(abs(diff(pStudentVpNonStuent))/diff(range(allData$Score.mean))*100,1)`% difference).

# Readability scores

This section uses the file `EvoLang_ReadingScores_E8_to_E12.csv`. It includes the following variables:

-  `conference`:  Conference
-  `gender`:  Gender of first author
-  `student`:  Student status
-  `format`:  Full paper or short abstract
-  `char_count`, `word_count`, `sent_count`, `sybl_count`:  Number of characters, words, sentences and syllables.  These distributions have been scaled and centrered.
-  `*_score`:  Various measures of readability, calculated using the tools from Hengel (2016).
-  Score.mean:   Mean raw score given by reviewers (scaled between 0 and 1, higher = better paper)

Read the data:

```{r}
readScores = read.csv("../data/EvoLang_ReadingScores_E8_to_E12.csv",stringsAsFactors = F)
```

We'll focus on the Flesch-Kinkaid score (since most other measures are highly correlated with it and it's easy to interpret) and the Dale-Chall score (which is not highly correlated with the other measures):

```{r}
round(cor(readScores[,c("flesch_score","fleschkincaid_score",
                        "gunningfog_score" ,"smog_score","dalechall_score"
                        )]),2)
```

Scale the variables:

```{r}
readScores$fleschkincaid_score_scaled = scale(readScores$fleschkincaid_score)
readScores$dalechall_score_scaled = scale(readScores$dalechall_score)
readScores$student[readScores$student=="EC"] = "Non-Student"
readScores$student[readScores$student=="Faculty"] = "Non-Student"
# Remove an outlier
readScores = readScores[readScores$fleschkincaid_score_scaled<6,]
readScores$gender = factor(readScores$gender)

readScores$conference = factor(readScores$conference,
                               levels = c("E8","E9","E10","E11","E12"))

# Box-Cox scaling
pp = preProcess(readScores[,
        c('fleschkincaid_score',"dalechall_score")], 
        method="BoxCox")
lambda.fk = pp$bc$fleschkincaid_score$lambda
lambda.dc = pp$bc$dalechall_score$lambda
readScores$fleschkincaid_score_norm = 
  bcPower(readScores$fleschkincaid_score, lambda = lambda.fk)
readScores$dalechall_score_norm = 
  bcPower(readScores$dalechall_score, lambda = lambda.dc)
readScores$Score.mean.norm = scale(readScores$Score.mean)

readScores$review = factor(c("Single","Double")[(readScores$conference %in% c("E11","E12"))+1])
readScores$student = factor(readScores$student)
readScores$format = factor(readScores$format)
```

Create `time` variable: a continuous variable increasing with each conference.

```{r}
readScores$time = as.numeric(readScores$conference)-3
```

Number of available datapoints (less than the total because some papers could not be automatically converted to text):

```{r}
table(readScores$conference,readScores$gender)
gtable2 = table(readScores$gender,readScores$conference,readScores$student)

There is an effect for format, but nothing else.

Mixed effects model across the whole readability data.  The model was not converging with a random slope for student, so:

contrasts(readScores$format) <- contr.sum(2)/2

m0 = lmer(fleschkincaid_score_scaled~ 1 +

           (1 + format + student + gender | conference),

Abstracts have higher reading scores than papers (marginally), but there are no other significant effects.

Differences by format, but no other effects.

## Reading scores and review scores

The simple correlations between reading score and review scores are weak, but suggest that higher scores are given to submissions with higher reading grades:

```{r}
cor.test(readScores$Score.mean, readScores$fleschkincaid_score)
cor.test(readScores$Score.mean, readScores$dalechall_score)

ggplot(readScores,
       aes(y=fleschkincaid_score,
           x=Score.mean)) +
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')
ggplot(readScores,
       aes(y=dalechall_score,
           x=Score.mean)) +
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

Are there interactions between reading scores and gender?

```{r}
m0 = lmer(Score.mean.norm~ 1 +
            format + student + gender +
           (1 | conference),
       data = readScores,
       control = lmerControl(optimizer = 'Nelder_Mead'),
       REML = F)
m1 = update(m0,~.+fleschkincaid_score_scaled)
m2 = update(m1,~.+fleschkincaid_score_scaled:gender)
anova(m0,m1,m2)
summary(m2)
```

Dale-Chall scores:

```{r}
m0 = lmer(Score.mean.norm~ 1 +
            format + student + gender +
           (1 | conference),
       data = readScores,

No interactions.

# Influence of last author

This study considered first authors, but future research could explore the effect of supervising authors and institutions. The data in this study is not ideal for exploring this, since the number of papers with multiple authors varies between conferences and there are many non-independencies.  The raw data is not made available here because the combination of factors make cases identifiable.

We investigated whether the review scores were biased by combinations of first author gender, last author gender and review type (mixed effects model with a random intercept for each conference). We note that the biggest change is for male-male authors from E10 (single-blind) to E11 (double-blind), which would be consistent with a gender bias being neutralised by double-blind review. However, statistically, there was only a significant main effect of format.

Here are the distributions of review scores by first and last author gender:
